## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer data to identify patterns and trends that lead to churn. By doing so, businesses can devise strategies to improve customer retention and satisfaction.

## Key Insights
- Younger customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
- Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn rates.
- Specific demographic groups show distinct churn behaviors.

## Data Sources
- [Kaggle Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered the dataset containing customer information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the data better.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created and selected relevant features for the model.
5. **Model Building**: Trained classification models to predict churn.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using various metrics.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations, such as:
- Correlation heatmaps
- Bar charts of churn rates by demographic segments
- ROC curves for model evaluation
