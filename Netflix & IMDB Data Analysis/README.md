## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Missing Data**  
   - Visualized missing values using a heatmap and handled them by removing rows with essential information missing.

   ```python
   import seaborn as sns
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
   sns.heatmap(netflix_data.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap="viridis")
   plt.title("Heatmap of Missing Values")
   ```

2. **Content Growth by Country**
   - Analyzed content growth in the USA and India by year.

   ```python
   usa_india_data = netflix_data[netflix_data['country'].isin(['United States', 'India'])]
   sns.lineplot(data=usa_india_data, x='year_added', hue='country', estimator=len)
   ```

3. **Genre Analysis**
   - Counted the number of shows in each genre to identify the most popular genres.

   ```python
   genre_count = netflix_data['listed_in'].str.split(',').explode().value_counts()
   sns.barplot(x=genre_count.values, y=genre_count.index)
   ```
